The dataset summarizes the usage behavior of approximately 9000 active credit card holders over the last 6 months. It is at the customer level and includes 18 behavioral variables. A customer segmentation model was developed to define a marketing strategy based on the following two characteristics:

1. Customers who make frequent purchases using their credit card (indicated by the PURCHASESFREQUENCY variable)
2. Customers who have high balances in their account (indicated by the BALANCE variable)

Tuned the hyperparameters to find the best set of clusters for each characteristic.
